# Introduction

To set up the modflow models in the Wierden area, different types of
data are required:

1.  Elevations of the different formations

2.  Hydraulic properties of the different formations

3.  Water management of the area

    1.  Diffuse drainage resistances (expressed as conductances).

    2.  Drain stages related to land-use types

4.  Open water

5.  Recharge stationary and transient

6.  Boundary conditions at the perimeter of the models domain

Steps 3 until 7 will be described in other documents.

Here the focus will be on the elevation of the different formation
layers and the hydraulic properties (HK, HV or ratio) of these
(combined) formations.

These data are based on LHM (Landelijk Hydrologisch Model) version 4.3.
maintained at [web page LHM
data](https://nhi.nu/modellen/lhm/ "url LHM") .

## Elevations of the different formations

With the help of [sub soil models region
Wierden](https://www.broloket.nl/ondergrondmodellen/kaart "BRO models")
the following cross section was created:

![cross section Wierden area](images/X-section_Y483026.png)

As shown in 'grey' the ice pushed ridge is described being a "gestuwde
afzettingen, complexe eenheid". No hydraulic conductivity or resistance
is assigned to this formation.

To get proper elevations from LHM data is a bit tricky!

There are 8 layers in the LHM model .

The layers are defined with top_elevations and bottom_elevations.

[Top elevations are:]{.underline}

"top_impermeable_layer1",

"top_impermeable_layer2",

"top_impermeable_layer3"

till "top_impermeable_layer8"

[Bottom elevations are:]{.underline}

"base_impermeable_layer1",

"base_impermeable_layer2",

"base_impermeable_layer3",

till "base_impermeable_layer8"

One would expect that the top of impermeable layer 2 coincides with the
bottom of impermeable layer 1. This is in good agreement most of the
time. Some deviations were noticed. Top 3 vs base 2 do differ in the
middle somewhat about 3 to 5 m over a short range.

Most striking is the difference between "base_impermeable_layer8" and
"geohydrological base". Not the clip below:

![base vs bot last (8) layer](images/hydrogeol_base_vs_bot_layer8.png)

I have no idea why this is!

Also tried to overlay the cross-section of the elevations (Qgis) with
the formations from REGIS 2.3, see the clip below

![](images/profiles_formations_hardly_matching.png)

Now considering another approach.

### Complex gestuwde formatie becomes formation with low K's

- Through the LHM data site; <https://data.nhi.nu/bekijk> downloaded the
  following sets:\
  horizontale_anisotropie_top.nc

- horizontale_anisotropie_bot.nc

With this the ice pushed ridges can be simulated with relative low
conductivities mimicken the anisotropical nature of the tilted
formations. How derive a proper K is not that easy since the formations
are not only clayey deposits.

With knowing the position and depth of the ridges we can now determine
three formations to model within modflow using the following elevation
data sets:

1.  surface elevations -\> "Lagenmodel_LHM43-top_impermeable_layer_1"

2.  top_ridges -\> "horizontale_anisotropie_top"

3.  bot_ridges -\> "horizontale_anisotropie_bot"

4.  hydrogeological base -\> "Lagenmodel_LHM43_base_impermeable_layer_8

The elevation of the hydrogeological base nicely aligns with the top of
the Breda formations which are clay deposits.

See the following clip:

![](images/location_depth_ridges.png)

As shown in the above clip, the ridges are only very locally present.

### Building model layers

**MODFLOW-NWT, 2005**

This means that for models based on modflow nwt or 2005 that model
layers are continous in the whole domain. Basically in the domain all
model layers will be present.

Now still two options for layers where the ridges are not present;

1.  thin layers, pinching out till the perimeter

2.  evenly distributed thicknesses of the layers (standard option used
    till now)

option 1 can give problems being too thin but also issues can arise
dry-wet issues. For example too thin layers where RCH need to be
extracted can result in problems drying out all cells at that point.

option 2 is most rubost but miss partly ridges when the center of a
model not coincides with the ridge.

#### Creating solids

To create new solids for the creation of mf-nwt models the following
recipe could work

Required are all elevations; surface, top-ridge, bot-ridge,
geohydrological-base

1.  Create a TIN

    1.  new coverage, large polygon extending the surface_elevation.tif
        but keep in within avoiding interpolation issues later on

    2.  set vertices on the polygon arc to 100 m

    3.  create the TIN by following the steps in the clip: ![creating
        TIN for layer elevations](images/create_TIN_4_elevations.png)

    4.  Map the elevations (i.e. the raster files ) to the individual
        TINs

    5.  Make sure that the numbering of the TIN's (mandatory) counts
        from bottom to top. So geohydrological base receives TIN number
        1:![TIN numbering from bottom to
        top](images/TIN_numbering4Solids.png){width="200"}

    6.  The next TIN is not the bottom of the ice pushed ridges which is
        only partly present. TIN nr. 2. The distribution can be seen in
        "bot_ridges.tif"):![top and locations of ice pushed
        ridges](images/distribution_ridges_top_elevations.png)

    7.  The top of the ice pushed ridges ("top_ridges.tif")

    8.  The upper TIN is nr. 4 and is based on "surface_elevation.tif"

    9.  Create solids from these TIN (horizons):![TIN_horizons to
        Solids](images/TIN_horizons2Solids.png)

    10. Define the top and bottom TIN elevation for the solids:![define
        the top and bottom TIN for building the
        solids](images/top_bot_solids.png)

    11. The following choices were used:![options used for building the
        Solids](images/options4buildingSolids.png) Natural neigbor with
        constant nodal function to avoid strange elevations. "Intersect
        horizon surfaces" according to the Help; "Allows the solids to
        intersect with horizon surfaces". In this case hardly noticeable
        differences.

    12. The solids 3 in this case should appear:![cross sections of
        solids based on top bot
        ridges](images/cross_sections_solids_basedon_local_top-bot_ridges.png)

    13. As an alternative I tried to use the "top_imp_layer_5.tif" which
        coincides with the bottom of the ice pushed ridges. With this
        the idea is that one distinguishes the upper 4 and lower 4
        layers of LHM4.3. This resulted in the following solids:![Solids
        based on the top of impermeable layer 5 distinguishing the upper
        from the lower aquifer](images/solids_based_topimplyer5.png)

        Now the ice-pushed ridge formation is extended way too much.

#### Creating solids with (dummy) boreholes and cross-sections

To improve the solids which should include the ice pushed ridges but not
extended in the whole domain **and** distinguishing the upper and lower
at the "top_impermeable_layer_5" which coincides the bottom of the ice
pushed ridge, boreholes created in QGIS(3,40) were created and exported
to a csv file. Two different sets were created in QGIS and with an R
script rewritten to the GMS boreholes format:

1.  borehole.txt

2.  borehole_ice_ridges.txt

Both borehole files we loaded into GMS (as "borehole data). Next step is
to "auto-create blank cross sections" and from that "auto-fill cross
sections" :

![create and fill cross sections from (dummy) borehole
data](images/create_fill_cross_sections.png)

This take quite a while to build but finally the following result
appears;

![filled cross sections with upper aquifer, local ice pushed ridges and
the lower aquifer](images/filled_cross_sections_wierden.png)

Now boreholes and cross-sections are available as well, the new solids
based on:

- TIN's

  - surface

  - top ridge

  - bot ridge

  - top imp_lyr5

  - base

- Boreholes and cross-sections auto-created and auto-filled

![new solids wierden area using elevation TIN's and
boreholes/cross-sections](images/New_solids_based_on_TIN_and_borholes_x_sections.png)

Although the ice pushed ridges (red) seem to do OK now, it's clearly
visible that the upper aquifer is way too thin and the lower one almost
the total thickness

So, it's still quite tricky to create solids showing local ice pushed
ridges AND a reasonable distribution of the upper and lower aquifer.

Again having a closer look at the cross sections and reconsidering the
order of formations, the current set looks like the following. This case
not snapped to the surface elevations but that will take place during
the solid creation.

![Latest set of boreholes and cross
sections](images/filled_cross_sections_wierden_dec_25.png)

What seems to work best now (d.d. 9-12-25) is the following:

1.  Select boreholes to create solids from there:![Base solids
    predominantly on the boreholes and
    x-sections](images/boreholes2solids_selection.png){width="180"}

2.  Now, [only]{.underline} select the boreholes and cross-section data
    to create the horizon solids:![Boreholes and x-sections only for
    horizon
    creation](images/boreholes2solids_useonly_boreholes-xsections_for_horizons.png){width="350"}

3.  Use the surface TIN as reference TIN and for the top elevation of
    the solids. For the bottom elevations of the solids the boreholes
    and cross-sections are used:![Selection of the Horizons for solid
    creation now based mainly on boreholes and
    x-sections](images/boreholes2solids_surface_reference_and_top_solids_bot_solids_boreh_x-sections.png)

4.  The last step selects the interpolation method, no minimal
    thickness:![Last step of solids
    creation](images/boreholes2solids_solid_creation.png)

These steps and data finally results a reasonable and better set of
solids compared to the first sets of about 2014-2015.

![Solids based on boreholes, cross sections and the surface elevation
TIN as reference and top of the solids. Bottom of the solids is based on
the bottom of the
boreholes/x-sections](images/solids_boreh_xsections_surface_tin_reference_and_top_solids_bot_solids_top_borh-x-sections.png)

**MODFLOW 6**

Since modflow 6 is based on UGRIDs, it is not required to have model
layers continuous in the model domain.

## Hydraulic properties of the different formations

The Holterberg is a dominant (hydro)geological feature in the Wierden
area. This ice pushed ridge and other hillish-elevated areas, originates
from the "Saalien" iceage about 150.000-200.000 yeas ago.

During that time, land ice coming from Scandinavia pushed forward the
formations which were deposited earlier. These mainly contain sandy,
gravely and clayey deposits. As a consequence, these formations were
pushed forward and sideways, resulting in tilted formations. The tilted
clayey formation within the ice pushed ridge result in **anisotropical**
properties, which means that groundwater flow will encounter different
hydraulic conductivities based on the direction of the formation of
these ice pusched ridges.

As a consequence, the Holterberg and ridges south-eastern from the
Holterberg need anisotropical parameters for the model layers where they
reside.

For the usual set up of a groundwater model in the Wierden we will
simply the effect of anisotropical features to a simple resistance or
better a relatively low hydraulic conductivity of **0.5 m/d.**

The upper aquifer (red in the upper clip) is based on the upper 4 LHM4.3
layers. The lower aquifer for the other 4 layers of LHM4.3:

|             |                  |                      |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Aquifer** | **K_mean (m/d)** | **K_std. dev (m/d)** |
| upper       | 26.4             | 13.23                |
| lower       | 16.54            | 17.14                |

## Water management of the area

In the Wierden area many land use type can be distinguished. The
following map illustrates the different type based on LGN24:

![Different land use types in the Wierden region based on
LGN24](images/LGN24.png)

Based on this map and using some GIS tricks (I think I used disolved and
other tools) these different land use type were aggregated to only the
five given in the table below. This table includes the related
watermanagement properties.

| Landuse type    | Drainage resistance (days) | Drain stage (cm. below surface) |
|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Grasslands      | 150                        | 80                              |
| Cropland        | 250                        | 100                             |
| Urban area      | 600                        | 120                             |
| Forest          | 1000                       | 80                              |
| Nature reserves | 50                         | 40(wet) 80(dry)                 |

The abovementioned aggregates land use type in the Wierden region are
illustrated in the following clip. These can be loaded into GMS as
polygons

![Aggregrated land use type in the Wierden
region](images/Landuse_Wierden_region.png)

For implementing these land use types, the following shape files (+
accompanying files) are available:

| Aggregates land use coverages |
|-------------------------------|
| Landuse_grass.shp             |
| Landuse_heath_nature.shp      |
| Landuse_forest.shp            |
| Landuse_urban.shp             |
| Landuse_cropland.shp          |

## Open Water

Few open water courses are present in the Wierden region. The main
purposes are discharging, nature conservation (re-meandering, fish
stairs), and tourism. The main and most dominant course is the Regge,
followed by the Eksosche Aa and the Doorbraak (since 2009, and only used
in an AHSA-project).

The hydraulic properties for the Regge and Eksosche Aa are already
packaged into the "Regge.shp" (+ accompanying files) file containing

- course of the open water reaches

- bottom width, side slope, bed slope

- river bed resistances, translated into conductances

- several weirs having prescribed upper and lower weir/water levels

![Open water data of the Regge and Eksoosche
Aa](images/Regge_Eks_Aa_data.png)

These data comes from the water board of "Vechtstromen" ; and is
recorded in the "legger"/register which can be found by this url:
[Legger (register) of waterboard
Vechtstromen](https://vechtstromen.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=4e12f4b0cb544e9db01343a890e6e54f).
The clip below illustrates the use of the (digital) legger:

![Use of the legger/register for retrieving open water
data](images/Legger_use.png)

## Recharge stationary and transient

Different approaches can be used to calculate the recharge rate entering
the subsoil. One of the simplest is calculating the Potential
evapotranspiration $E_{pot}$ by: $E_{pot}=E_{ref}*f_{crop}$. Where
$E_{ref}$ is the Reference evapotranspiration which comes from a
meteorological station (Twenthe; [weather data from
Twenthe](https://www.knmi.nl/klimaat-viewer/grafieken-tabellen/klimaattabellen-per-station/twenthe/klimaattabel_twente_1991-2020)
) and $f_{crop}$ stands for crop factors and depends obviously on the
land use type (and season). The daily precipitation and reference
evapotranspiration of this station can directly downloaded from this
url: [link to daily meteo
data](https://daggegevens.knmi.nl/klimatologie/daggegevens)

A more advanced procedure is used in LHM4.3 in which the METASWAP
component calculates the actual recharge depending on soil properties,
groundwater table depth, moisture content/pressure head and land use.
This is readily available for use and can be imported as a raster file:
"LHM_stationary_recharge_m_d.tif"

### Stationary recharge

Although the different soil types are not included in the distribution
of the different recharge types the LHM_recharge rates reasonably
overlap the land use coverages.

![Overlap land use coverages with LHM recharge raster
data](images/landuse_cov_matches_LHM_Recharge.png)

### Transient recharge OLD (till 25-26)

~~Using the transient recharge time series of LHM4.3 is not feasible for
this course because this includes very large data sets of time series
(in NC format) for each pixel in the domain. In addition, these pixel
cannot be assigned to land use type only since the soil properties also
play an important role in calculating the recharge.~~

~~For the transient recharge, three different recharge time series were
calculated based on an R-script containing soil properties for the
unsaturated and saturated zone, time series for precipitation and
reference evapotranspiration. At three locations in an imaginary
cross-section from the Holterberg towards the Regge, flow was calculated
in the unsaturated zone (Richards) and saturated zone (Darcy). The
following clip illustrates this model:~~

![~~illustration of a cross section simulating saturated and unsaturated
zone flow~~](images/transient_cross_section.png)

~~The net result used in this course is the recharge for higher regions
(forest), shallow regions (grass) and recharge for urbanized areas.
Since the output also consists of time series of moisture contents in
each profile, the average storage coefficient (specific yield,~~
$S_y$~~) can also be determined. For this, the saturated moisture
content is subtracted from the current mean moisture content of the
whole unsaturated zone;~~
$S_y(t)=\theta_{sat}-\frac{1}{Z}\int\theta(t) dz$

~~To distinguish higher and lower zones, a more or less arbitrary
groundwater table is chosen of 4.0 m below surface.~~

~~The simulated and aggregate 10-daily recharge for the different zone
is shown in the following clip of time series.~~

![~~Recharge of different zone and precipitation time series, right axis
indicate precipitation rate in cm/d~~](images/10_daily_rch_per_zone.png)

~~These time series were simulated with a really old set of R-scripts
making use of the very first versions of the FVFE1D package, which was
not even a package then.~~

~~The R-scripts are:~~

- ~~general_cross_section.R~~

- ~~sat_cross_section.R~~

- ~~unsat_cross_section.R~~

- ~~flow1D_16_10_12.R (the predecessor of FVFE1D package)~~

~~To avoid cumbersome reprogramming of these R codes, the scripts are
adjusted for the minimum. Only the meteorological data is adjusted to
recent time series and the time step is set to 1 day instead of 1/2
day.~~

~~Moreover another version of general_cross_section.R exists which
calculates the storage coefficients based on~~
$S_y(t)=\theta_{sat}-\frac{1}{Z}\int\theta(t) dz$ ~~for each time
step.~~

~~This is not included in the used general_cross_section.R. However,
these coefficients, on average, will not change that much based on the
meteo data of 1985-1995. Therefor the "S-data.csv" will still be used
for the practical to simulate transient conditions. The clip below
illustrates these storage coefficient time serie of the three unsat
zones in the transect.~~

![~~Sy time series for the three zones during
1985-1995~~](images/Sy_time_series_85-95.png)

### NEW Transient recharge (dd july 2026)

For academic year 26-27 new recharge time series are calculated with
SWAP(4.30)

At this date 3 different typical landuse/soil types are selected:

| Recharge series | Landuse | Soil type(s) | BC bottom | Lat. drainage |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| deep | Mixed forest | B05, O05 | free drainage | No |
| cropland | crop rotation 10years | B02, O02 | $q_{bot}=\frac{H_{reg}-H_{swap}}{C}$ | Yes |
| grassland | pasture | B02, O02 | as cropland | Yes |

: SWAP simulations for transient recharge

The simulated times series are from 04-01-2015 till 31-12-2024

Details regarding the setup of these simulations can be found in
`Transient_recharge` Git-folder.

Be aware that in GMS the Sy data requires a GMS-coverage for Sy only but
for all layers and that the Recharge requires a seperate coverage for
only the upper layer.

Moreover, if a warning appears (after mapping Sy and Recharge) that Sy
and Ss are 0.0 for the materials (the formation), the "use data arrays"
should be checked instead of the material ID in the UPW setup.

The Ss could be set to e.g. 0.001 for all cells.

### NEW Approach of importing transient recharge

When importing transient recharge time series with XYS files, cells with
more than one landuse/soil type (so multiple poly overlaying the cell)
NOT the areal average recharge rate but the SUM of the different
recharge rates are assigned to that cell. NO idea why.

A better approach, which is demonstrated in the "Managing Transient
Data" GMS tutorial.

Here all landuse/soiltypes polys of `landuse_transient_recharge.shp` can
be assigned transient recharges in one go.

The recharge rates are now calculated with SWAP. The result CSV's were
used to create 10daily recharge rates and (originally) exported to GMS'
XYS format. Those were used to setup a CSV file containing all 10daily
recharge rates for each landuse/soiltype which can directly imported
into a GMS transient recharge coverage (recharge rates checked) based on
the aforementioned shape file.

The CSV recharge rate file `trans_recharge_polys_import.csv` should have
the following format;

![format csv file importing transient recharge
rates](images/Format_import_transient_recharge.png)

### Procedure for importing transient recharge rates

load `landuse_transient_recharge.shp` into GMS

create a new GMS coverage with `Areal properties*|Recharge rate` checked

convert feature object of the shape file to the new GMS coverage, ONLY
mapping the names

select this GMS coverage with the transient recharge names

Go to main (top) menu and select (the folder icon) "open" and load
`trans_recharge_polys_import.csv`

check the Heading row

![import wizard step 1, transient
recharge](images/trans_recharge_import_step1.png)

Select the "Transient Polygon data" GMS data type in the following step

![import wizard step 2, transient
recharge](images/trans_recharge_import_step2.png)

Select "Recharge rate TS" for the last column.![Selecting appropriate
GMS data type](images/trans_recharge_import_step2_2.png)

### NEW Specific yield ($S_y$) calculations

#### $S_y$ Thick unsaturated zones

For areas with groundwater tables deeper than 4 m, bottom boundary
condition (SWAP) is set to free drainage. Idea is that the
pressure/moisture profile are quite constant in the deeper part of the
profile, since only gravity determines the flow downwards. As a
consequence the gradient is about zero;
$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z}\approx 0$. This results in the
following Darcy flux flowing out of the profile:
$q_{bot}= K(\psi)\left( 0+1\right)=K(\psi)=K(\theta(\psi))$

The specific yield is now calculated by:
$S_y= \frac{\sum(\theta_s-\theta_r)\Delta z -WTOT}{Z}$

$\theta_s - \theta_r$ is the available space to store moisture per nodes
($\Delta z$).

$WTOT$ is the total stored moisture in the whole profile.

Results are illustrated in the following graph:

![Specific yiel deep groundwater tables](images/Sy_Holterberg_deep.png)

Through the year the following specific yields are determined:

![Sy for each day of year](images/Sy_deep_dayofyear.png)

#### $S_y$ grassland and cropland

Here the SWAP simulations contain a bottom boundary condition which is
based "Calculate exchange flux from hydraulic head of deep aquifer"
`SWBOTB=3` in SWAP.

As a consequence a hydraulic head is calculated in the SWAP profile.

With this we can approximate the specific yield based on change of the
total amount stored in the profile against the change in groundwater
head; $S_y=\frac{\Delta WTOT}{\Delta GWT}$

By plotting the total stored water ($WTOT$ ) against the groundwater
head for all time steps a pattern is revealed, showing that drying and
wetting profiles are indeed different (showing hysteresis). The graphs
below illustrate this for both grassland and cropland;

![WTOT vs GWT grassland](images/Sy_grassland.png)

![WTOT vs GWT cropland](images/Sy_cropland_drn100.png)

Calculating the derivative, is similar to fit a line through the points
where the slope is the approximated Specific yield.

Since modflow (except MF6) requires one value, a straight line is fitted
through the data.

### Pitfalls switching to transient

Be aware that the simulation is transient now, meaning that:

- stationary observations (heads) should be removed from modflow

- be sure to start observations time series **later** than the first
  simulation time step

  - NO warning given in GMS. MF simply crashes

  - In the OUT file at the bottom something is mentioned about this

- starting heads should be set to the stationary heads
