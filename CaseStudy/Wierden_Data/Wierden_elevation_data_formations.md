# Introduction

To set up the modflow models in the Wierden area, different types of
data are required:

1.  Elevations of the different formations

2.  Hydraulic properties of the different formations

3.  Water management of the area

4.  Open water for discharging

    -   river dimensions (width, side slopes, length profiles(verhang))

    -   river bed resistance

    -   weir levels

    -   Discharge volumes of water

5.  Ditches and (tile)drains for draining agricultural and urban area's

6.  Recharge stationary and transient

7.  Boundary conditions at the perimeter of the models domain

Steps 3 until 7 will be described in other documents.

Here the focus will be on the elevation of the different formation
layers and the hydraulic properties (HK, HV or ratio) of these
(combined) formations.

These data are based on LHM (Landelijk Hydrologisch Model) version 4.3.
maintained at [web page LHM
data](https://nhi.nu/modellen/lhm/ "url LHM") .

## Elevations of the different formations

With the help of [sub soil models region
Wierden](https://www.broloket.nl/ondergrondmodellen/kaart "BRO models")
the following cross section was created:

![cross section Wierden area](images/X-section_Y483026.png)

As shown in 'grey' the ice pushed ridge is described being a "gestuwde
afzettingen, complexe eenheid". No hydraulic conductivity or resistance
is assigned to this formation.

To get proper elevations from LHM data is a bit tricky!

There are 8 layers in the LHM model .

The layers are defined with top_elevations and bottom_elevations.

[Top elevations are:]{.underline}

"top_impermeable_layer1",

"top_impermeable_layer2",

"top_impermeable_layer3"

till "top_impermeable_layer8"

[Bottom elevations are:]{.underline}

"base_impermeable_layer1",

"base_impermeable_layer2",

"base_impermeable_layer3",

till "base_impermeable_layer8"

One would expect that the top of impermeable layer 2 coincides with the
bottom of impermeable layer 1. This is in good agreement most of the
time. Some deviations were noticed. Top 3 vs base 2 do differ in the
middle somewhat about 3 to 5 m over a short range.

Most striking is the difference between "base_impermeable_layer8" and
"geohydrological base". Not the clip below:

![base vs bot last (8) layer](images/hydrogeol_base_vs_bot_layer8.png)

I have no idea why this is!

Also tried to overlay the cross-section of the elevations (Qgis) with
the formations from REGIS 2.3, see the clip below

![](images/profiles_formations_hardly_matching.png)

Now considering another approach.

### Complex gestuwde formatie becomes formation with low K's

-   Through the LHM data site; <https://data.nhi.nu/bekijk> downloaded
    the following sets:\
    horizontale_anisotropie_top.nc

-   horizontale_anisotropie_bot.nc

With this the ice pushed ridges can be simulated with relative low
conductivities mimicken the anisotropical nature of the tilted
formations. How derive a proper K is not that easy since the formations
are not only clayey deposits.

With knowing the position and depth of the ridges we can now determine
three formations to model within modflow using the following elevation
data sets:

1.  surface elevations -\> "Lagenmodel_LHM43-top_impermeable_layer_1"

2.  top_ridges -\> "horizontale_anisotropie_top"

3.  bot_ridges -\> "horizontale_anisotropie_bot"

4.  hydrogeological base -\> "Lagenmodel_LHM43_base_impermeable_layer_8

The elevation of the hydrogeological base nicely aligns with the top of
the Breda formations which are clay deposits.

See the following clip:

![](images/location_depth_ridges.png)

As shown in the above clip, the ridges are only very locally present.

### Building model layers

**MODFLOW-NWT, 2005**

This means that for models based on modflow nwt or 2005 that model
layers are continous in the whole domain. Basically in the domain all
model layers will be present.

Now still two options for layers where the ridges are not present;

1.  thin layers, pinching out till the perimeter

2.  evenly distributed thicknesses of the layers (standard option used
    till now)

option 1 can give problems being too thin but also issues can arise
dry-wet issues. For example too thin layers where RCH need to be
extracted can result in problems drying out all cells at that point.

option 2 is most rubost but miss partly ridges when the center of a
model not coincides with the ridge.

#### Creating solids

To create new solids for the creation of mf-nwt models the following
recipe could work

Required are all elevations; surface, top-ridge, bot-ridge,
geohydrological-base

1.  Create a TIN

    1.  new coverage, large polygon extending the surface_elevation.tif
        but keep in within avoiding interpolation issues later on

    2.  set vertices on the polygon arc to 100 m

    3.  create the TIN by following the steps in the clip: ![creating
        TIN for layer elevations](images/create_TIN_4_elevations.png)

    4.  Map the elevations (i.e. the raster files ) to the individual
        TINs

    5.  Make sure that the numbering of the TIN's (mandatory) counts
        from bottom to top. So geohydrological base receives TIN number
        1:![TIN numbering from bottom to
        top](images/TIN_numbering4Solids.png){width="200"}

    6.  The next TIN is not the bottom of the ice pushed ridges which is
        only partly present. TIN nr. 2. The distribution can be seen in
        "bot_ridges.tif"):![top and locations of ice pushed
        ridges](images/distribution_ridges_top_elevations.png)

    7.  The top of the ice pushed ridges ("top_ridges.tif")

    8.  The upper TIN is nr. 4 and is based on "surface_elevation.tif"

    9.  Create solids from these TIN (horizons):![TIN_horizons to
        Solids](images/TIN_horizons2Solids.png)

    10. Define the top and bottom TIN elevation for the solids:![define
        the top and bottom TIN for building the
        solids](images/top_bot_solids.png)

    11. The following choices were used:![options used for building the
        Solids](images/options4buildingSolids.png) Natural neigbor with
        constant nodal function to avoid strange elevations. "Intersect
        horizon surfaces" according to the Help; "Allows the solids to
        intersect with horizon surfaces". In this case hardly noticeable
        differences.

    12. The solids 3 in this case should appear:![cross sections of
        solids based on top bot
        ridges](images/cross_sections_solids_basedon_local_top-bot_ridges.png)

    13. As an alternative I tried to use the "top_imp_layer_5.tif" which
        coincides with the bottom of the ice pushed ridges. With this
        the idea is that one distinguishes the upper 4 and lower 4
        layers of LHM4.3. This resulted in the following solids:![Solids
        based on the top of impermeable layer 5 distinguishing the upper
        from the lower aquifer](images/solids_based_topimplyer5.png)

        Now the ice-pushed ridge formation is extended way too much.

#### Creating solids with (dummy) boreholes and cross-sections

To improve the solids which should include the ice pushed ridges but not
extended in the whole domain **and** distinguishing the upper and lower
at the "top_impermeable_layer_5" which coincides the bottom of the ice
pushed ridge, boreholes created in QGIS(3,40) were created and exported
to a csv file. Two different sets were created in QGIS and with an R
script rewritten to the GMS boreholes format:

1.  borehole.txt

2.  borehole_ice_ridges.txt

Both borehole files we loaded into GMS (as "borehole data). Next step is
to "auto-create blank cross sections" and from that "auto-fill cross
sections" :

![create and fill cross sections from (dummy) borehole
data](images/create_fill_cross_sections.png)

This take quite a while to build but finally the following result
appears;

![filled cross sections with upper aquifer, local ice pushed ridges and
the lower aquifer](images/filled_cross_sections_wierden.png)

Now boreholes and cross-sections are available as well, the new solids
based on:

-   TIN's

    -   surface

    -   top ridge

    -   bot ridge

    -   top imp_lyr5

    -   base

-   Boreholes and cross-sections auto-created and auto-filled

![new solids wierden area using elevation TIN's and
boreholes/cross-sections](images/New_solids_based_on_TIN_and_borholes_x_sections.png)

Although the ice pushed ridges (red) seem to do OK now, it's clearly
visible that the upper aquifer is way too thin and the lower one almost
the total thickness

So, it's still quite tricky to create solids showing local ice pushed
ridges AND a reasonable distribution of the upper and lower aquifer.

Again having a closer look at the cross sections and reconsidering the
order of formations, the current set looks like the following. This case
not snapped to the surface elevations but that will take place during
the solid creation.

![Latest set of boreholes and cross
sections](images/filled_cross_sections_wierden_dec_25.png)

What seems to work best now (d.d. 9-12-25) is the following:

1.  Select boreholes to create solids from there:![Base solids
    predominantly on the boreholes and
    x-sections](images/boreholes2solids_selection.png){width="180"}

2.  Now, [only]{.underline} select the boreholes and cross-section data
    to create the horizon solids:![Boreholes and x-sections only for
    horizon
    creation](images/boreholes2solids_useonly_boreholes-xsections_for_horizons.png){width="350"}

3.  Use the surface TIN as reference TIN and for the top elevation of
    the solids. For the bottom elevations of the solids the boreholes
    and cross-sections are used:![Selection of the Horizons for solid
    creation now based mainly on boreholes and
    x-sections](images/boreholes2solids_surface_reference_and_top_solids_bot_solids_boreh_x-sections.png)

4.  The last step selects the interpolation method, no minimal
    thickness:![Last step of solids
    creation](images/boreholes2solids_solid_creation.png)

These steps and data finally results a reasonable and better set of
solids compared to the first sets of about 2014-2015.

TIN as reference and top of the solids. Bottom of the solids is based on

**MODFLOW 6**

Since modflow 6 is based on UGRIDs, it is not required to have model
layers continuous in the model domain.

## Hydraulic properties of the different formations

The Holterberg is a dominant (hydro)geological feature in the Wierden
area. This ice pushed ridge and other hillish-elevated areas, originates
from the "Saalien" iceage about 150.000-200.000 yeas ago.

During that time land ice coming from Scandinavia pushed forward the
formations which were deposited earlier. These mainly contain sandy,
gravely and clayey deposits. As a consequence these formation were
pushed forward and sideways resulting tilted formations. The tilted
clayey formation within the ice puschd ridge result in **anisotropical**
properties, which means that groundwater flow will encounter different
hydraulic conductivities based on the direction of the formation of
these ice pusched ridges.

As a consequence the Holterberg and south-eastern ridges from Holterberg
need anisotropical parameters for the model layers where they reside.

For the usual set up of a groundwater model in the Wierden we will
simply the effect of anisotropical features to a simple resistance or
better a relatively low hydraulic conductivity of 0.5 m/d.

The upper aquifer (red in the upper clip) is based on the upper 4 LHM4.3
layers. The lower aquifer for the other 4 layers of LHM4.3:

|             |                   |                      |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Aquifer** | **K_mean (m/d)**  | **K_std. dev (m/d)** |
| upper       | 26.4              | 13.23                |
| lower       | 16.54             | 17.14                |
